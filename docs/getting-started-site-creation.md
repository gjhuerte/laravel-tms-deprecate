title: Creating your site
---

Docusaurus was created to hopefully make it super simple for you to create a site and documentation for your open source project.

After [installation](getting-started-installation.md) and [preparation](getting-started-preparation.md), much of the work to create a basic site for your docs is already complete.

## Site Structure

Your site structure looks like the following:

```bash
root-directory
├── docs
└── website
    ├── blog
    ├── core
    │   └── Footer.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── pages
    ├── sidebars.json
    ├── siteConfig.js
    └── static
```

> This assumes that you removed the example `.md` files that were installed with the [initialization](getting-started-installation.md) script.

All of your documentation files should be placed inside the `docs` directory as markdown `.md` files. Any blog posts should be inside the `blog` directory.

> The blog posts must be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD-your-file-name.md`

## Create Your Basic Site

To create a fully functional site, you only need to do a few steps:

1.  Add your documentation to the `/docs` directory as `.md` files, ensuring you have the proper [header](api-doc-markdown.md#documents) in each file. The simplest header would be the following, where `id` is the link name (e.g., `docs/intro.html`) and the `title`, is, of course, the title of the browser page.

    ```yaml
    ---
    id: intro
    title: Getting Started
    ---

    My new content here..
    ```

1.  Add zero or more docs to the [`sidebars.json`](guides-navigation.md#adding-docs-to-a-sidebar) file so that your documentation is rendered in a sidebar, if you choose them to be.

> If you do not add your documentation to the `sidebars.json` file, the docs will be rendered, but they can only be linked to from other documentation and visited with the known URL.

3.  Modify the `website/siteConfig.js` file to [configure your site](api-site-config.md), following the comments included in the [docs](api-site-config.md) and the `website/siteConfig.js` to guide you.
1.  Create any [custom pages](guides-custom-pages.md#customizing-your-site-footer) and/or [customize](guides-custom-pages.md#customizing-your-site-footer) the `website/core/Footer.js` file that provides the footer for your site.
1.  Place assets, such as images, in the `website/static/` directory.
1.  Run the site to see the results of your changes.

```bash
cd website
yarn run start # or `npm run start`
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
```

## Special Customization

### Docs Landing Page

If you prefer to have your landing page be straight to your documentation, you can do this through a redirect.

1.  Remove the `index.js` file from the `website/pages` directory, if it exists.
1.  Add a [custom static `index.html` page](guides-custom-pages.md#adding-static-pages) in the `website/static` directory with the following contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=docs/id-of-doc-to-land-on.html">
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.location.href = 'docs/id-of-doc-to-land-on.html';
    </script>
    <title>Your Site Title Here</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    If you are not redirected automatically, follow this <a href="docs/id-of-doc-to-land-on.html">link</a>.
  </body>
</html>
```

> You will get the `id` of the document to land on the `.md` metadata of that doc page.

### Blog Only

You can also use Docusaurus to host your [blog only](guides-blog.md#i-want-to-run-in-blog-only-mode).
